# NeuralStyle-TF-GPU

Neural Style Transfer (NST) is a technique in machine learning and compute vision that allows the fusion of two images: One representing the content and the other the style. The result is a new image (generated image) that combines the content structure with the artistic features of the style image.

This project implements NST using Tensorflow with GPU acceleration via CUDA, leveraging the VGG19 pre-trained model for feature extraction.

## Features
- **Tensorflow GPU Acceleration:** Uses Tensorflow and CUDA for optimal training speed.
- **VGG19 Pre-trained Model:** Employs a modified VGG19 model for effective content and style extraction.
- **Noise Initialization:** Starts with content image and noisy for enhanced stylization effects.

## Dependencies
This project was made with the following main dependencies/configuration:
- **Python** version **3.10**
- **CUDA** version **11.2**
- **cuDNN** version **8.1**

## Results

Below are some example results produced by this neural style transfer project. Each output image combines the content of one image with the style of another:

- With around 4000 iterations

| Content Image | Style Image | Generated Image |
|----------|----------|----------|
| <img src="https://github.com/Jordi17z/NeuralStyle-TF-GPU/blob/main/images/claude_monet.jpg" alt="Content Image 1" width="400" height="400"> | <img src="https://github.com/Jordi17z/NeuralStyle-TF-GPU/blob/main/images/drop-of-water.jpg" alt="Style Image 1" width="400" height="400"> | <img src="https://github.com/Jordi17z/NeuralStyle-TF-GPU/blob/main/generated_images/water_monet.jpg" alt="Result Image 1" width="400" height="400"> |

- With around 1000 iterations

| Content Image | Style Image | Generated Image |
|----------|----------|----------|
| <img src="https://github.com/Jordi17z/NeuralStyle-TF-GPU/blob/main/images/content_image.jpg" alt="Content Image 1" width="400" height="400"> | <img src="https://github.com/Jordi17z/NeuralStyle-TF-GPU/blob/main/images/style_image.jpg" alt="Style Image 1" width="400" height="400"> | <img src="https://github.com/Jordi17z/NeuralStyle-TF-GPU/blob/main/generated_images/generated_image.jpg?raw=true" alt="Result Image 1" width="400" height="400"> |



## How to Run the Application

- **Option 1:** With jupyter.
- **Option 2:** Using the python script. Place your content and style images in the images/ directory.
Run the main script (example):
```bash
python .\Neural-Style.py --content images/mona_lisa.jpg --style images/stone_style.jpg --output stone_lisa
```
